# Food-Order
Online Food Order is the process of ordering food. The process consists of a customer scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up. There is usually a delivery charge for this service.

The main aim of this project is to deliver food from restaurant through this application. The customer will login or signup as per requirements then the user can select the item as per choice. This system is developed in java, using inheritance, customization of GUI, jtables, database, array-list, swing GUI and some more. Food order system is helpful as user can order food online without going to the restaurant. Each item in the menu has a different price as we have in the restaurant menu. After choosing the preferences from the menu a bill is generated which is specific regarding the rate, quantity and total cost. This is a secure system as user has to either login or signup and system uses database to store data in it.
